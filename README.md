# GDP Per Capita Dashboard

## Description
This project involves extracting, profiling, and analysing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Per Capita data I extracted from Kaggle. The focus of this project was to create a dashboard which includes key information, such as the average GDP per capita by region, the GDP estimate from the IMF vsthe UN, and several other useful insights. This projects aims to provide insightful visualisations for better undertsanding and interpretation of the data.

## Installation
Cleaned Data, Analysed Data, and the Dashboard:
	GDP Dashboard

All of the cleaned and analysed data is in this Excel file.

## Process
Data Importation: I downloaded all of the raw data from Kaggle, and then imported it all into Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning: I then formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, that there is no missing data, there is no duplicated data which is not needed, and corrected any errors and inconsistencies within the data. 

Data Analysis: I analysed the data to create useful insights, such as the average GDP per capita by region, the GDP estimate from the IMF vsthe UN, etc. I did this by using a range of data analysis skills, such as VLookups, Excel Functions, and Pivot Tables. 

Data Visualisations: I used the pivot tables to then create insightful visualiations to show a range of insights in the two dashboards that I created
